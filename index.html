          <h2>missile man of india</h2>
          <p>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
            Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member
            of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
            career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by
            his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working
            under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was
            interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first
            Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27]
            In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's
            first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed
            the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had
            first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at
            DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval
            and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25] Kalam
            addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati In 1963 to 1964, he
            visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard
            Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight
            Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort
            to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III
            projects, both of which proved to be successful. Kalam was invited
            by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling
            Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not
            participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed
            two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to
            develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV
            programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime
            Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace
            projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's
            directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union
            Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace
            projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him
            great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the
            government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his
            directorship.[29] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and
            scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion
            by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for
            simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking
            planned missiles one after another.[30] R Venkatraman was
            instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88
            billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development
            Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30]
            Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the
            mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and
            Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the
            projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time
            overruns.[30][31] Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to
            the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which
            he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam
            served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala
            Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][32] Media coverage of
            Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear
            scientist.[33] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam,
            said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised
            Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam and
            Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[35] In 1998, along with
            cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent,
            named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".[36][37] In 2012, the duo designed a
            rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was
            named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".[38]
